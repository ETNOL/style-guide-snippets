*** Style Guide Snippets

A simply utility to populate code snippets with a sample. Very similar to what you see on
Bootstrap's or Foundation's example pages. Prevents code having to be maintained in two different
places on style guides.

Use class ".code-sample" on the outer container element of what you'd like to see as a snippet.

    <div class="code-sample">
        <button>Press it.</button>
    </div>
